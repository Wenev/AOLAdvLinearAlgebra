# Advanced Linear Algebra AOL

> A compact Python toolkit to **analyze matrices** for an Advanced Linear Algebra project. This README is a complete guide with theory bites, clean implementations, and copyâ€‘paste examples.

## ðŸš€ Whatâ€™s Inside

This project focuses on four classic linearâ€‘algebra routines:

1. **Diagonalizability test** for a square matrix.
2. **LU decomposition** (with partial pivoting) for a square matrix.
3. **Power Method** for the dominant eigenvalue (and eigenvector).
4. **Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)** for any matrix.
